          <p>
            Since its founding eight years ago, the Prince Group has emerged as
            one of Cambodia’s most ubiquitous brands. Its name touches nearly
            every corner of the Cambodian marketplace: shopping malls,
            supermarkets, banks, casinos, apartments, cinemas, office blocks,
            private jets, pleasure boats, film production, hotels, venture
            capital firms, ride-hailing services, restaurants and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company’s reach also extends well beyond Cambodia. Its leaders
            have a controlling interest in at least three companies listed on
            the Hong Kong stock exchange. Prince Chairman Chen Zhi, an enigmatic
            36-year-old Chinese national

              >who rose</a
            >
            to become a top adviser to both Cambodia’s current and former prime
            ministers, owns a quarter of Cuba’s national cigar company, valued
            at $2.8 billion, as well as a $114 million office building in one of
            London’s richest neighborhoods.
          </p>

          <p>
            In total, RFA has identified more than $1.5 billion of assets and
            investments in 31 countries in which senior Prince Group executives
            have a stake.
          </p>

          <p>
            The group, however, has never fully accounted for its wealth. It
            maintains that its multi-billion dollar growth over the past eight
            years is due to savvy business practices and what was, until
            recently, Cambodia’s relentlessly booming property market.
          </p>

          <p>
            But an RFA investigation that includes court records, banking
            documents, payment slips and interviews with company insiders tells
            a different story.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the
            <a

          </p>

          <p>
            Here we explore how the Prince Group has stealthily moved millions
            of dollars around the world in a way that experts say bears many of
            the hallmarks of money laundering.
          </p>

          <p>
            RFA's investigation has revealed that a company controlled by Chen,
            Amiga Entertainment, registered in the Isle of Man, is in fact a
            shell company that uses these suspected money laundering tactics.

            >
            that much of the money Prince has used to build its empire was
            acquired through fraud, including hundreds of millions from illegal
            gambling and an extensive money laundering network.
          </p>

          <p>
            RFA has attempted to contact Chen on numerous occasions without
            success, but the Prince Group disputes the charges against both the
            company and its chairman. A spokesperson for the company responded
            to allegations of illegality in Chinese courts by claiming it is a
            victim of identity theft and that criminals have used its corporate
            identity to carry out illicit activities.

          <h6>The wealthy uncle</h6>

          <p>
            In December 2018, a company owned by Prince Group founder Chen named
            Amiga Entertainment applied for an account with the Cayman National
            Bank in the Isle of Man. The bank rejected the company’s request,
            despite the fact that by then the Prince Group was a key player in
            the Cambodian marketplace. A
            <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Sherwood" target="_blank"
              >hack</a
            >
            of the bank's records 11 months later gives a clue as to why.
          </p>

          <p>
            Money laundering is the process of making money gained through
            illegal means appear legitimate. It usually involves bouncing the
            money through a series of fictitious transactions, often spanning
            multiple jurisdictions, to give the illusion that it is the product
            of legitimate business activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emails, transaction records and other documents contained within the
            hack, which was shared by whistleblowing non-profit
            <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Sherwood" target="_blank"
              >Distributed Denial of Secrets</a
            >, chart Amiga Entertainment’s failed attempt to land an account
            with Cayman National Bank. The hack showed the Prince Group was
            unwilling to reveal the source of its money – even when applying for
            a bank account.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any time a person or a business applies for a bank account or
            conducts a large transaction, bank officials
            <a
              href="https://www.iomfsa.im/media/2628/customerduediligence.pdf"
              target="_blank"
              >are supposed</a
            >
            to ask where the money comes from and to verify the claims as best
            they can. This process is designed to prevent criminals from getting
            access to the financial system and spending their ill-gotten gains.
            In the case of Amiga Entertainment, the due diligence carried out by
            Cayman National Bank shows just how little the mega-conglomerate was
            willing to share about the source of its funds.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the time of the application, Amiga’s immediate parent company was
            an Isle of Man online casino operator named Ableton Prestige Global
            Limited. An email to the bank by Ableton director John Corteen,
            which was among the hacked documents, reveals that Ableton’s owners
            were Prince Group chairman Chen and his wife, Li Caiyun. Corteen
            included a link to a
            <a
              hre="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501080645/https://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/prince-central-plaza-completes-construction"

              >Prince Group advertisement</a
            >
            in the Phnom Penh Post to provide “some details of Mr. Chen’s
            businesses.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The bank responded by seeking more information about the origins of
            Chen’s wealth.
          </p>

          <p>
            “In respect of Mr. Chen Zhi's source of wealth, Mr. Chen Zhi first
            obtained a personal loan of US$2 million from his uncle to start
            Cambodian Heng Xin Real Estate Investment Co. Ltd. sometime in or
            around 2011,” reads an internal Cayman National Bank file note
            summarizing the response of Chen’s representatives, dated July 2019.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chen’s explanation for the origins of his fortune would be
            unacceptable to most banks, according to financial crime expert
            Graham Barrow, who spent 25 years working for banks and the wider
            financial services industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            “An uncle who lends you $2 million is such a generic statement as to
            be wholly inadequate for any financial institution to accept because
            they need to understand the ultimate source of wealth, not an
            intermediate source,” Barrow told RFA. “It gives the impression that
            they don’t want anyone to dig too deep into their source of wealth.”
          </p>

          <p>
            A little over two months after the file note was created, a
            compliance official at the bank sought more details, in an email
            dated Oct. 7, 2019. Crucially, she wanted to know the name of the
            uncle who loaned Chen the $2 million in 2011 and where he got the
            money.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chen and his representatives never responded, which is another red
            flag, according to Oliver Bullough, author of
            <a

          </p>

          <p>
            “If someone asks you to explain your wealth and you go away, that’s
            not a good sign because it isn’t that difficult to do,” Bullough
            told RFA.
          </p>

          <p>
            Corteen and Chen did not respond to requests for comment on the
            issues raised in this story. Emails to the address listed on Amiga's
            website bounced back with an error message indicating the message
            had been blocked, while emails to Ableton went unanswered.

          <p>
            If the mystery funds set off alarm bells, the ownership structure of
            Amiga may well have rung others.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the time of its incorporation in October 2018, Amiga
            Entertainment’s ultimate parent company was the Singapore-registered
            Infinite Deemarco Pte Ltd. The man listed in Singapore company
            records as Infinite Deemarco’s owner at that time, a Filipino
            American lawyer named Henry Yeh, told RFA that he had no idea where
            the company’s financing came from.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I was told that it came from China as Prince [management] are all
            from China,” Yeh said. “They have every right not to tell me or to
            lie to me as I was just an employee.”
          </p>

          <p>
            In admitting that he was the owner in name only, Yeh shed light on
            how Prince Group frequently manages its subsidiaries as a series of
            shell corporations so that their connection to the group is not
            apparent from their shareholders and directors. A 2022

            This “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to managing billions of
            dollars is familiar to Kimberly Kay Hoang, a University of Chicago
            sociology professor who spent 18 months shadowing Southeast Asian
            investment professionals for her book
            <a

            The book reveals the way high-level business is done in the region,
            allowing politically connected individuals to merge their illicit
            wealth with legitimate business enterprises.
          </p>

          <p>
            CEOs like Yeh find themselves “assuming all the criminal and
            reputational risk and being highly compensated for doing it,” Hoang
            told RFA. In exchange, they “generally don’t ask questions about the
            origin and source of funds.” Yeh is not accused of any wrongdoing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eighteen months after he founded the company, Yeh transferred his
            shares to an individual who holds directorships in three Prince
            Group companies in Cambodia, according to Singaporean and Cambodian
            corporate records reviewed by RFA.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ben Cowdock, a senior investigator at Transparency International
            U.K., also believes Yeh’s description of arrangements at Infinite
            Deemarco are cause for concern.
          </p>

          <p>
            “If you have the CEO and shareholder of a company not knowing where
            their business earns money, they’re either wildly negligent or
            acting on behalf of someone else,” Cowdock told RFA, having been
            briefed on Infinite Deemarco's ownership structure. “Those putting
            their name on official paperwork for a third party is a widely known
            method of avoiding undue scrutiny from the authorities.”

            low-level employees have determined that at least 5 billion yuan
            ($700 million) of Prince Group funds are from illegal gambling.
          </p>

          <p>
            RFA's investigation into Amiga Entertainment sheds additional light
            on how Prince Group sought to hide where its money came from.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was during Yeh’s brief tenure as Infinite Deemarco’s owner and
            CEO that the company incorporated Amiga Entertainment as its
            subsidiary in the Isle of Man. Yeh told RFA that Amiga
            Entertainment’s business model was, “to make similar games without
            infringing IPs [intellectual property].” In essence, to produce
            cheap knock-offs of already existing video games.
          </p>

          <p>
            Documents reviewed by RFA show the true business model was more
            complex.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amiga Entertainment’s
            <a
              href="https://www.amigaentertainment.com/games.html"

            >
            showcases the games it develops. Each one is essentially a slot
            machine, with players placing bets in the hope that certain
            combinations of symbols appear. Such games are legal in the Isle of
            Man. However, banking records seen by RFA show that Amiga was
            licensing these games to companies in China, where – outside of the
            state lottery – all forms of gambling are strictly forbidden.

          <hr style="height: 2em" />

          <p>
            The contracts specified that the Chinese companies would pay
            £940,000 ($1 million) a year in exchange for the right to market one
            of Amiga Entertainment’s games to their customers. Additionally, the
            Chinese companies would pay 30% of any revenue earned. (Asked about
            these contracts, Yeh responded, "I don’t know anything about copycat
            games for millions.")
          </p>

          <p>
            The twist, according to a former Prince insider who was familiar
            with the workings of Amiga Entertainment and its parent companies,
            is that these transactions were fictitious. The insider asked not to
            be named for safety reasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            “[Amiga Entertainment] is the one they used for laundering money,”
            the person told RFA. “They pumped in all the money through here.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The companies in China were neither utilizing the games nor paying
            for them, the source claimed. Instead, the contracts signed between
            Amiga Entertainment and the Chinese companies were used to justify
            large cash transfers between Southeast Asia and the Isle of Man.
          </p>

          <p>
            Typically, businesses move money from one area of their operation to
            another through a bank. But the money sent to Amiga Entertainment
            came instead from a money services operator in Hong Kong. Also known
            as remittance agencies, money services operators transfer funds
            internationally on behalf of customers, who are frequently people or
            small businesses that cannot access traditional banking. Some, such
            as Western Union, have become household names. There are, however,
            thousands of smaller operators across the world, such as the one
            used by Amiga Entertainment’s purported Chinese clients. Remittance
            agencies charge far steeper fees than banks, and it is highly
            unorthodox for a large company to move money in this way. With the
            higher fees, though, come fewer questions.
          </p>

          <p>
            “The remittance company doesn’t care where the real source of money
            is,” the person said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Copies of remittance slips, contracts and invoices reviewed by RFA
            bore details that correlated with payments that could also be
            identified in the Cayman National Bank leak. While Amiga
            Entertainment never had an account with the bank, a money services
            operator that handled payments for the company was a client. (Four
            payments worth a total of $830,000 were identified within Cayman
            National Bank’s records as destined for Amiga Entertainment Limited
            all bore the reference CLA0878, which was also the payment reference
            used on the remittance slips reviewed by RFA.)
          </p>

          <p>
            “The Isle of Man will ask what’s the reason for the money, so you
            need a proxy in China,” the Prince insider said, referring to the
            licensees. In reality, “the money never originated in China,” they
            added.

            Once the money had been remitted to Amiga Entertainment’s account in
            the Isle of Man, it would begin its journey up through the various
            layers of the company’s ownership, the source continued.
          </p>

          <p>
            Corporate records seen by RFA back up the source’s account and
            indicate that the ultimate destination for the funds would be Chen
            and his wife’s family office in Singapore. The money would appear as
            the legitimate profits from the couple’s investment in successful
            Isle of Man gambling businesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            An internal spreadsheet of Amiga Entertainment’s finances viewed by
            RFA suggests that more than $100 million was moved this way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Transparency International’s Cowdock said the transactions appeared
            highly suspicious and called on the Isle of Man to investigate.
          </p>

          <p>
            “If someone is selling licenses for gambling games to a country
            where this activity would be illegal, and accepts payments outside
            of usual banking channels, this is a major red flag that needs
            investigating,” said Cowdock.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Prince Group’s director of communications, Gabriel Tan, told RFA
            in an email that the company’s “primary focus lies in investments
            and developments within Cambodia” and that it is “not involved in
            the allegations you mentioned regarding activities in … Singapore,
            Cuba, or the Isle of Man.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “In all his business dealings, Chairman Chen Zhi consistently
            complies with the laws of the jurisdictions in which he operates, as
            well as with those governing him as a Cambodian citizen,” Tan added.

            Entertainment’s website returned error messages, suggesting the

            Across the Atlantic, three Prince Group executives own mansions in

            owns a 26-meter Sunseeker pleasure yacht docked off the coast of
            California, along with a luxury car dealership and a sex toy
            manufacturer in the state, according to California court and

            High-end homes in London and LA are typical trappings of the
            ultra-wealthy. But a source close to Cambodia's Interior Ministry
            suggested another motivation for the Prince executive migration:
            having a place to run to if China's investigation into the
            conglomerate expands.
          </p>

          <p>
            “In 2019, the Chinese ambassador told Chen Zhi to cease all criminal
            acts and not to interfere in investigations into his people,” the
            source said, asking not to be named as they were not authorized to
            speak publicly. “The Chinese government has not come to extradite
            anyone since Covid began, but they will.”
