            Panha has an idea of the horrors that take place within the Golden
            Fortune Science and Technology Park in Cambodia’s southeastern
            border town Chrey Thom. He has witnessed what happens to those who
            try to leave.
          </p>

          <p>
            “When they recapture escaped workers they beat them until they’re
            barely alive. I’ve seen it with my own eyes,” Panha told RFA,
            declining to give his family name. His brother, he said, is head of
            security at the 15-acre (four-hectare) facility, and Panha has
            watched him hunt down escapees. “If you don’t beat them they will
            stop being afraid and more will try to escape.”
          </p>

          <p>
            While the compound is ostensibly open to the public, and billed as
            an industrial park, it is surrounded by a 10-foot-high (three-meter)
            concrete wall topped with barbed wire. Its heavy, metal front gate
            is manned by uniformed security guards, who bar entry to ordinary
            visitors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Built by the powerful and well-connected Prince Group, the facility
            now counts cyberscam operations among its businesses, according to
            witnesses, staff and former employees. While the group denies any
            involvement in the park, it is run by a company headed by Prince
            executives and bears several other indicators of connections to the
            group.

            Inside, locals allege, trafficked Vietnamese, Malaysian and Chinese

            Fourteen local residents – among them current and former employees
            working at the Golden Fortune compound – separately told RFA they
            had witnessed security guards violently subduing escaped workers
            before returning them to the compound. For security reasons,
            witnesses requested their names not be used. At least two other
            Prince Group-linked properties have previously been connected with
            human trafficking and cyberscam operations, according to

            Prince Group spokesperson Gabriel Tan told RFA that while the
            conglomerate built the Golden Fortune compound, it did so at the
            request of a client, whom he declined to identify. Asked about
            allegations of trafficking and cyberscam operations within the
            compound he added, “we are unaware of the incident you mentioned.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Cambodian corporate records suggest that the park’s parent company,
            Golden Fortune, is run by Ing Dara, a businessman with extensive
            ties to the Prince Group. He holds directorships in a number of
            Prince companies, including one cited by the Prince Group’s founder
            as the ultimate source of his wealth in disclosures to an offshore
            bank. Ing Dara and Golden Fortune could not be reached for comment.

            This final installment in the three-part investigation into the
            company explores allegations that one of its facilities holds
            victims of Asia’s blossoming cyber-slavery industry.

          <p>
            Chrey Thom is a one-road town abutting the Bassac river just a few
            hundred yards upstream from Vietnam. Like many border communities in
            Cambodia, the town is thick with casinos built to service foreigners
            who face restrictions on gambling in their own countries.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Cambodian government crackdown against online casinos in 2019
            forced many to close. In some cases, the empty real estate has been
            taken over by criminal gangs that force trafficked workers to
            perform cyber fraud. Such frauds have exploded in recent years, in
            particular “pig butchering” in which victims are lured into putting
            large sums of money into phony investment schemes. However, those
            performing the scams are often also victims held against their will
            and forced to find people to dupe using various online platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            As cyberscam operations have proliferated, they’ve also been found
            operating in office blocks, apartment complexes and what appear to
            be purpose-built compounds.

            Set on 15 acres of land and surrounded by concrete walls topped with
            barbed wire, the Golden Fortune facility hosts a soccer field, a
            basketball court and 18 large dormitory style buildings, all of
            which were constructed since mid-2019, according to satellite
            imagery reviewed by RFA.
          </p>

          <p>
            Metal bars cover the dormitory windows on each of the five floors,
            suggesting they are designed to keep people in.

          <p>
            Those allegedly imprisoned inside are mostly Vietnamese and Chinese,
            locals said. Cambodians work inside the compound, too, in security
            roles. Online Khmer-language advertisements for jobs within the
            compound seen by RFA called for Cambodians who speak Vietnamese,
            offering a salary of $600-800 a month on top of three meals a day
            and accommodation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though relatively well-paid, such work is wholly unappealing to
            60-year-old Moeun, who asked that her full name not be used. She
            spoke with RFA reporters while standing in the thigh-high oily water
            of a drainage canal, catching fish with her bare hands.
          </p>

          <p>
            “If we don’t do good work and torture they will cut our salaries, so
            we prefer to come here and catch some fish to get some money,” said
            Moeun, whose children had worked inside the compound. “Besides
            working for them, what else can we do?”

            Her account was confirmed by a current Golden Fortune employee, who
            told RFA that disobedient or unproductive workers are detained on
            the first floor of a building named B1 and violently punished. Many
            female workers in the complex are forced into prostitution and
            pornography, the staffer added.

            compound, where they are abused and forced to help run illegal
            online gambling scams.

          <p>
            “The problems in there are like what the Chinese movie has

            According to the employee, besides the scams, prostitution and
            pornography, extortion is another business model. Victims are
            released only if their families pull together adequate ransom – a
            common

            “If ransom was not provided as demanded, mistreatment, beating and
            electrocution would be used and video clips [about the torture] are
            sent to the family to see,” the staffer said.

            Another local resident, who lives near the compound told RFA that he
            had seen security guards knock escapees to the ground with a car and
            tase them with electric cattle prods before driving them back to the
            compound. He claimed local police are employed as security guards at
            the compound.
          </p>

          <p>
            Local Sampav Poun commune police chief Khuth Bunthorn told RFA that
            he was unaware of any cases of detention or forced labor in his
            commune.
          </p>

          <p>
            A former security guard at the Golden Fortune compound told RFA that
            trafficked scam employees worked 12 hours a day and would usually be
            sold on to another compound within six to 12 months. The former
            guard added that while they were no longer employed at Golden
            Fortune, they would still occasionally hunt down escaped workers
            from the compound. Local residents told RFA that Golden Fortune
            doles out $50 bounties for returned escapees.

            Interior Ministry Secretary of State Chou Bun Eng, who is secretary
            general of the National Committee for Counter Trafficking, told RFA
            that she was unaware of any trafficking cases in Chrey Thom.

            RFA reporters were barred from entering the Golden Fortune compound
            when they visited Chrey Thom last year, with security guards
            declining to say why.

            Footage posted to social media in September showcases an array of
            restaurants, massage parlors and even a small hospital within its
            walled kingdom. Both the videos and satelite imagery indicate it is
            home to more and higher quality paved roads than the surrounding
            village. In one video, a billboard within the park can be glimpsed
            advertising 6,700-square-foot (622-square-meter) villas in Phnom

            The Prince Group bills itself as one of Cambodia’s hottest
            conglomerates, with interests in everything from real estate to film
            production. It was founded a little under a decade ago by Chen Zhi,
            a politically connected Chinese émigré who became a naturalized
            Cambodian in 2014. Chinese court documents have

            his conglomerate a “notorious transnational online gambling criminal
            group” and alleged at least 5 billion yuan ($700 million) of its
            revenue came from illegal online gambling.

            that 45 individuals had been found guilty of establishing illegal
            online casinos in collaboration with the Prince Group. The
            announcement listed three locations in Cambodia where this had taken
            place, among them was “Caitong City,” the Chinese name for Chrey
            Thom.
          </p>

          <p>
            The eyewitness testimony related to RFA would suggest that like so
            many online gambling operations in Cambodia, the Prince Group has
            pivoted to forced labor.

            Cambodian Heng Xin Real Estate has two directors, both of whom have
            extensive links to the Prince Group. One of them, Ing Dara, is
            listed as the chairman of Golden Fortune Resorts World, whose name
            and address matches the Chrey Thom complex.

            Such linkages between Prince Group property and cyberscam operations
            could prove awkward for Prince’s political patrons. These include
            recently retired Prime Minister Hun Sen, former Interior Minister
            Sar Kheng, former National Assembly President Heng Samrin, as well
            as the current Prime Minister Hun Manet – each of whom Chen serves
            as an officially appointed political adviser.

            China, Cambodia’s most forceful sponsor on the world stage, has made
            clear its intention to crack down on cybercrime overseas. In
            October, Cambodia’s newly appointed premier, Hun Manet, met with
            Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Buried on the third page of
            a press release issued by Cambodia’s Foreign Ministry after the
            meeting was a commitment, “to further enhance cooperation in law
            enforcement, particularly in combating cross-border gambling, drug
            and human trafficking, cybercrime and fake news.”
          </p>

          <p>
            For some in Chrey Thom, though, that cooperation could not come soon
            enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            One resident of Chrey Thom said he and his neighbors would always
            try to help whenever they encountered an escapee. He remembered one
            time in particular, when cries of, “Thief, thief, thief,” preceded a
            bedraggled man crashing into his home.
          </p>

          <p>
            “He put his hands together and begged for mercy,” he recalled,
            adding that he gave the man five dollars before sending him on his
            way, wishing he could have done more for him.
          </p>

          <p>
            “We pity them and the injustice they suffer, but we cannot do
            anything,” he said.
